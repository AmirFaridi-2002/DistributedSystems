# Distributed Systems Projects

This repository contains a series of distributed systems projects completed as part of the Distributed Systems course at the University of Tehran. The assignments are the same as [MIT 6.824: Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/).

Each subdirectory contains a self-contained project designed to incrementally build a robust understanding of distributed system concepts, including consensus algorithms, key-value stores, and MapReduce computation.

## Project Structure

### 📁 `RaftConsensusAlgorithm/`
Implementation of the **Raft consensus algorithm**.

### 📁 `MapReduce/`
Implementation of the Map-Reduce algorithm.

### 📁 `KeyValue_Server/`
An implementation of a **fault-tolerant, replicated Key-Value store** and a design of **distributed mutex lock** using the KV-server.

### 📁 `srv-client/`
Contains a simple **server-client** as a warm-up project
